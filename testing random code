Here are some code snippets for creating a simple note-taking app in Python:

1. Basic command-line note-taking app:
```python
import datetime

def create_note():
    note = input("Enter your note: ")
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
    note_entry = f"{timestamp}: {note}\n"

    with open("notes.txt", "a") as notes_file:
        notes_file.write(note_entry)

def read_notes():
    with open("notes.txt", "r") as notes_file:
        notes = notes_file.readlines()
        for note in notes:
            print(note)

def main():
    while True:
        print("1. Create Note")
        print("2. Read Notes")
        print("3. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            create_note()
        elif choice == "2":
            read_notes()
        elif choice == "3":
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

2. Note-taking app with GUI using tkinter:
```python
import datetime
import tkinter as tk

def create_note():
    note = entry.get()
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
    note_entry = f"{timestamp}: {note}\n"

    with open("notes.txt", "a") as notes_file:
        notes_file.write(note_entry)

    entry.delete(0, tk.END)  # Clear the text entry

def read_notes():
    text.delete(1.0, tk.END)  # Clear the text widget
    with open("notes.txt", "r") as notes_file:
        notes = notes_file.read()
        text.insert(tk.END, notes)

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Note Taking App")

label = tk.Label(root, text="Enter your note:")
label.pack()

entry = tk.Entry(root)
entry.pack()

create_button = tk.Button(root, text="Create Note", command=create_note)
create_button.pack()

read_button = tk.Button(root, text="Read Notes", command=read_notes)
read_button.pack()

text = tk.Text(root)
text.pack()

root.mainloop()
```

Note: In both examples, the notes are stored in a "notes.txt" file in the same directory as the Python script.
